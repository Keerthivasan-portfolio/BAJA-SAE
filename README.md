As the Vice-Captain of my collegiate off-road racing team, I was responsible for assisting, leading, and coordinating the design, build, and assembly of a single-seater ATV for national-level BAJA SAE competitions.

My primary focus was on the powertrain subsystem, where I handled component modeling using SolidWorks and conducted structural analysis through FEA in ANSYS to validate critical parts under dynamic loading conditions. Alongside this, I actively collaborated with and led other subsystems such as brakes and suspension, ensuring cohesive integration and design compatibility across the vehicle. 

After successfully assembling and extensively testing our ATV, the team secured an All-India Rank of 11 in the Design Evaluation and achieved 4th place in the Sales Presentation event, marking one of the teamâ€™s best overall performances.
